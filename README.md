### Overview
This project focuses on analyzing aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 to identify aircraft types with the lowest risk profiles. The company is expanding into the aviation industry and needs to make informed decisions about purchasing aircraft for commercial and private operations. The primary stakeholder is the head of the new aviation division, who requires clear insights into aircraft safety to minimize operational risks and guide investment decisions. The project is situated within the aviation sector, specifically targeting risk assessment for aircraft acquisition.

### 2. Business Understanding

The company wants to enter the aviation market but is uncertain about the safety risks associated with different aircraft types. Without data-driven insights, they risk investing in high-risk models that could lead to operational losses or reputational damage.

### 2.1. Stakeholders

- Business stakeholders: Head of the aviation division, company executives.
- Industry stakeholders: Airlines, regulatory bodies (e.g., FAA, NTSB), passengers.

### 3. Data Understanding

The dataset originates from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and encompasses civil aviation accident records spanning from 1962 to 2023. It contains thousands of rows and includes columns such as:

- Event Date: Date of the accident
- Aircraft Type: Model or category of aircraft
- Injury Severity: Fatal, serious, minor, or none
- Location: Where the accident occurred
- Cause: Probable cause or contributing factors
- Number of Fatalities: Count of deaths per incident
  
This data provides a comprehensive view of aviation safety across decades.

### 4. Data Analysis
Guided by the business objectives, the analysis will focus on:
- Calculating accident rates by aircraft type and manufacturer.
- Examining accident trends over time and across different aircraft categories (commercial vs. private).
- Identifying factors correlated with higher or lower risk.
- Visualizations such as bar charts and line graphs will be created to illustrate these findings clearly. The analysis will use pandas for data   manipulation and Tableau for interactive visualization

These analyses help answer key business questions about which aircraft are safest and how risk changes over time.

### Conclusion

This project will provide a comprehensive assessment of aircraft safety risks based on historical accident data. The findings will highlight the safest aircraft types and manufacturers, reveal important trends, and support the companyâ€™s strategic decision-making as it enters the aviation market.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, the project will deliver at least three actionable recommendations, such as:
- Prioritizing the purchase of aircraft types with consistently low accident rates.
- Avoid manufacturers or models with poor safety records.
- Monitoring emerging trends in accident data to adjust risk assessments over time.
